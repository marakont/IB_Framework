# IB_Framework
This repository contains example code for the intensity bioassay framework.

Example data is provided in the data folder. 
The scripts folder (src) contains:
1. The Stan example model code in the stan folder. This model is the 5-parameter logistic base model described in the paper.
2. R scripts to generate dose-response curves and other metrics. Code to generate single or multiple curves are provided.

The repository is set up in the structure for which the script is written up. An RProject file is provided as well as (empty) outputs folder. Output backups are provided in the 'backup' folders, but running the script anew would generate outputs in that initial folder.
